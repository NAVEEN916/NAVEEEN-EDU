      Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than
      55,000 years ago.[27][28][29] Their long occupation, initially in varying
      forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly
      diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled
      life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river
      basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley
      Civilization of the third millennium BCE.[31] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form
      of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
      northwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the
      Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the
      Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian
      languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western.<hr>
      regions.[35] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged
      within Hinduism,[36] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming
      social orders unlinked to heredity.[37] Early political consolidations
      gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges
      Basin.[38] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging
      creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and
      the incorporation of untouchability into an organized system of
      belief.[k][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms <del>In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
